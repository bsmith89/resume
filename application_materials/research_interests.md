#### Statement of Research Interests ####

My long-term research goals are focused on the application of novel statistical
and bioinformatic approaches to dissect the function and consequences of
complex microbial communities.
For many relevant microbial systems, discovery research is severely limited by
widespread unculturability, and our inability to recapitulate realistic
community physiology.
My interests are in developing and utilizing methods that allow for robust
inference about the function of individual taxa and communities while not
requiring the types of precise experimental interventions that are so
challenging in microbial systems.
For my PhD I have focused on the integration of heterogeneous data
(compositional, chemical, and host features) to understand the importance of
the microbiome in a mouse model of lifespan extension.
During my work, I have explored approaches to overcome the inherent
limitations of relative abundance data.
This study and others have convinced me of the value of model based
statistical inference, and I intend to further establish my expertise in this
paradigm during my post-doctoral training.
In particular, I want to use sophisticated statistical models to leverage
experimental manipulations of the microbiota and hosts towards better
understanding of the community ecology.

I was originally drawn to the study of microbial communities because of the
vast and mostly unexplored complexity,
as well as the potential for beneficial impacts from intelligent management of
consortia.
These interests are applicable in a wide variety of
systems including host-associated and environmental microbiomes.
I believe that my research and career will benefit from working with
a tractable study system, especially one with the potential to inform
important applications.
The Turnbaugh Lab's focus on microbial processing of the drugs and food that
we ingest matches these goals.
I am particularly interested in collaborating with members of your lab
possessing expertise in host physiology and microbial genetics and in
integrating advanced analysis approaches into ongoing projects, especially
those using new experimental manipulations, such as defined communities.
I would also appreciate access to local experts in bioinformatics,
computational methods, and statistics.
Dr. Katie Pollard, for instance, particularly appeals to me as a potential
collaborator and co-mentor.

## Research Goals

1.  Sources of variability in host associated community composition

    Why are gut microbial communities so variable across individuals?
    Using statistical models to partition variation between individuals,
    temporal, geographic, and genetic effects, as well as ecological processes.

2.  Statistical modeling of microbial community composition

    Dirichlet multinomial models, spike-in modeling, covariance structure in
    absolute abundance, clustering of OTUs and communities.

3.  Computer assisted inquiry into microbial community dynamics

    Using the tools of graphical modeling to leverage a combination of causal
    constrains and environmental variability for causal inference.
    Designing experiments using these tools that manipulate key components
    of microbial communities in order to determine proximate causality.
